# Entity Framework Mapping Fixes

Here are the issues we identified and fixed with the Entity Framework mapping:

## 1. User Model Issues

### Column Name Mismatches
- Original: `[Column("Amazon Prime")]` 
- Fixed: `[Column("AmazonPrime")]`

Similar fixes for:
- "Disney+" → "DisneyPlus"
- "Paramount+" → "ParamountPlus"
- "Apple TV+" → "AppleTVPlus"

### Data Type Mismatch
- The `Zip` field in the User class was defined as `int?` but the database column is a string
- Fixed: Changed the User model to `string? Zip` and in the controller `user.Zip = model.Zip.ToString();`

## 2. Movie Model Issues

### Column Name Mismatches
Fixed column attributes with spaces to match the actual database column names:
- "Anime Series International TV Shows" → "AnimeSeriesInternationalTVShows"
- "British TV Shows Docuseries International TV Shows" → "BritishTVShowsDocuseriesInternationalTVShows"
- And many others similar column names

## 3. Rating Model Issues

### Nullable DateTime
- Made the `Timestamp` property nullable (`DateTime?`) to handle potential null values from the database

## 4. UsersController Issues

### Syntax Issues
- Fixed missing commas between object initializer properties
- Fixed missing commas between method parameters

## Effect of These Changes

These fixes align the Entity Framework model classes with the actual database schema in Azure SQL, enabling proper:
- Object-relational mapping
- Query generation
- Database operations

The deployment is in progress to apply these fixes to the Azure App Service hosting the API.
