# Movies App Azure Deployment - Summary & Next Steps

## Current Status

| Component | Status | URL |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| Frontend | ✅ Deployed | https://moviesappsa79595.z22.web.core.windows.net/ |
| Backend API | ⚠️ Deployed but returns 500 error | https://moviesapp-api-fixed.azurewebsites.net/ |
| Azure SQL Database | ✅ Created and data populated | moviesapp-sql-79427.database.windows.net |

## Work Completed

1. ✅ Fixed connection string in appsettings.json by adding the missing comma between server name and port
2. ✅ Deployed backend API to Azure
3. ✅ Created tables in Azure SQL Database
4. ✅ Populated tables with sample data
5. ✅ Verified database connectivity and sample data presence

## Current Issue

The API is returning a 500 error. This could be due to one of the following:

1. Entity Framework mapping issues between models and database tables
2. Missing columns or mismatched column names in the database tables
3. Configuration issues in the deployed application

## Recommended Next Steps

### Short-term Solution

1. Set up GitHub repository integration to deploy the app from source control:
   ```bash
   # From your project root
   cd MoviesApp
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. In Azure Portal, enable Application Insights for the backend API to get detailed error logs:
   - Navigate to your App Service in Azure Portal
   - Search for "Application Insights" in the left menu
   - Click "Turn on Application Insights"
   - Choose your region and save

3. Consider using a simpler database schema for initial testing:
   - Create a new branch in your repository with simplified models
   - Remove unnecessary columns and complex relationships
   - Test with simplified data first

### Long-term Solution

1. Implement proper database migration using Entity Framework Core:
   ```bash
   dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
   dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

2. Consider using Azure Key Vault for secrets storage instead of embedding them in appsettings.json
3. Implement proper logging and error handling in the backend API
4. Set up staging and production environments with proper CI/CD pipelines

## GitHub CI/CD Integration

The project already has GitHub Actions workflows configured in:
- `.github/workflows/backend-ci-cd.yml`
- `.github/workflows/frontend-ci-cd.yml`

Once you push your code to GitHub, you'll need to set up GitHub repository secrets:
- `AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE` 
- `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN`

## Database Migration Strategy

For future database changes, consider:

1. Use Entity Framework Core migrations for schema changes
2. Use a database-first approach with `Scaffold-DbContext` for existing databases
3. Implement proper backup and restore procedures

## Security Considerations

1. Move connection strings and other secrets to Azure Key Vault
2. Implement proper authentication and authorization
3. Configure CORS policies to restrict access to your API
4. Set up Azure Security Center for monitoring
