# Allowing the Secret on GitHub

The API key has already been replaced in all the relevant files with a placeholder, but GitHub's secret scanning is still detecting the key in the commit history. Even after trying to rewrite the Git history, GitHub is still rejecting the push.

## Recommended Action

The most practical solution at this point is to use the URL that GitHub provides to **allow this specific secret**:

```
https://github.com/zmcdougal82/IntexDos/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/2vaawa3Lkvb7dEXuvKNjf7XXk3R
```

This will tell GitHub that you're aware of this secret and want to allow it in the repository history.

## Next Steps

1. Visit the URL above
2. Select a reason for allowing the secret (such as "The secret has been revoked and is no longer valid")
3. Submit the form
4. Try pushing again

## Security Considerations

Since we've already replaced the actual key with a placeholder in all the config files, and if you've revoked or rotated the Mailgun API key, allowing this particular secret scan result is a reasonable approach. 

For future development:
- Continue using the placeholder approach we've implemented
- Consider using environment variables instead of config files for sensitive keys
- Look into secure key management solutions like Azure Key Vault for production environments
