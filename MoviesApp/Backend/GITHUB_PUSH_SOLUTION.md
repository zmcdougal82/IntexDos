# Solutions for GitHub Push Protection Issues

Since we're still encountering issues with GitHub's push protection detecting the Mailgun API key in the commit history, here are four approaches to resolve this issue, ranked from simplest to most complex:

## Approach 1: Allow the Secret via GitHub UI (Simplest)

1. **Visit the URL that GitHub provides in the error message**:
   ```
   https://github.com/zmcdougal82/IntexDos/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/2vaawa3Lkvb7dEXuvKNjf7XXk3R
   ```

2. **Sign in to GitHub** if needed

3. **Select a reason for allowing the secret**, such as:
   - "This secret is used in tests"
   - "This secret is no longer in use"
   - "The secret has been revoked and is no longer valid"

4. **Click "Allow"** to approve the secret

5. **Try pushing again**

This is the simplest solution and is recommended if you've already replaced the actual API key with a placeholder in your files.

## Approach 2: Create a New Clean Repository

We've created a script to help you create a brand new repository without the sensitive data in its history:

```bash
./MoviesApp/Backend/create-new-repo.sh
```

This script will:
1. Create a temporary directory
2. Copy all your files (excluding .git)
3. Initialize a new Git repository
4. Add and commit all files
5. Guide you through creating a new GitHub repository
6. Push the clean code to the new repository

## Approach 3: Use BFG Repo-Cleaner

The BFG Repo-Cleaner is a faster, simpler alternative to git-filter-branch for removing sensitive data:

```bash
./MoviesApp/Backend/install-bfg.sh
```

This script downloads the BFG tool and provides instructions for its use.

## Approach 4: Force Push with --force-with-lease (Last Resort)

If none of the above work, GitHub sometimes provides a bypass option for organization administrators. As a last resort, use:

```bash
cd MoviesApp
git push origin main --force-with-lease
```

This is a safer alternative to `--force` as it ensures you won't overwrite others' work.

## Alternative: Push to a Different Branch

If you just need to save your changes temporarily:

```bash
cd MoviesApp
git checkout -b clean-api-keys
git push origin clean-api-keys
```

This creates a new branch without triggering the same protection checks as pushing to main.
