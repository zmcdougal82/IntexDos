# Recommendation System Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to the MoviesApp recommendation system to provide continuous recommendations in the "Movies Similar Users Enjoyed" section and eliminate duplicate recommendations across different sections.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Tiered Recommendation System
We've implemented a progressive recommendation system that automatically relaxes constraints as users navigate deeper into the recommendations:

- **Tier 0 (First 40 recommendations)**: Strict collaborative filtering using exact match ratings
- **Tier 1 (Next 40 recommendations)**: Extended collaborative filtering with genre matching
- **Tier 2+**: Further relaxed genre and rating requirements
- **Final Fallback**: Popular and trending movies when all personalized recommendations are exhausted

### 2. SQL Query Optimizations
- Redesigned SQL queries to be compatible with SQL Server's subquery requirements
- Fixed ORDER BY clause issues in Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Implemented temporary tables for better performance with complex queries
- Ensured all queries used proper pagination

### 3. Duplicate Prevention
- Implemented a global tracking system for all recommendation sections
- Recommendations shown in one section (collaborative, content-based, or genre) won't appear in others
- Maintained unique recommendations across pagination boundaries

### 4. Error Recovery & Fallbacks
- Added robust error handling to recover from database query failures
- Multiple fallback mechanisms to ensure users always see recommendations:
  1. Primary collaborative recommendations
  2. Extended collaborative with genre preferences
  3. Genre-specific recommendations
  4. Popular movies across all users
  5. Top-rated movies
  6. Random sampling as last resort

## Frontend Integration
The frontend `HomeRecommender.tsx` component was updated to:
- Handle loading status properly
- Preload images for smoother transitions
- Stop showing loading indicators indefinitely
- Handle asynchronous recommendation loading

## Deployment
To deploy these changes to Azure:
1. Use the `deploy_manually.sh` script in this directory
2. The script will automatically create a deployment package and upload it to Azure
3. No manual Azure portal changes are needed

## Testing
You can verify these improvements by:
1. Continuously clicking the arrow buttons in the "Movies Similar Users Enjoyed" section
2. You should be able to endlessly browse recommendations
3. Verify that no movie appears in multiple recommendation sections

## Technical Details
- The `get_collaborative_recommendations` function now uses a tiered approach based on offset
- `get_extended_collaborative_recommendations` uses the user's preferred genres
- `get_recommendation_fallbacks` provides several layers of fallback options
